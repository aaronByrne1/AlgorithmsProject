Aaron Byrne was in charge of part 2. The implementation of the ternary search tree to search by stop name.

Ross Donnelly was in charge of part 1. Finding the shortest paths between 2 bus stops which returns the list of stops and en route and also returns the cost. He used Djikstras algorithm to implement this.

Stephen Cashin was in charge of part 3. Stephen implemented part 3 by using a binary search tree to search for all the times in the stop_times.txt file. It returns all the entries that match that arrival time and its sorted by trip id.

Cillian Byrne was in charge of part 4. Cillian had to implement the interface and include alot of error handling for various inputs provided.
